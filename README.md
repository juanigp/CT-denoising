# CT denoising
 Code made during the work of my thesis on CT denoising for the title of Electronics Engineering at Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahia Blanca, Argentina.
Directors: Claudio Delrieux PhD, Felix Thomsen PhD
## Notebooks:
 - __Hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb__: Training and testing of the proposed neural network with different values for learning rate and batch size.
 - __Hyperparameter_analysis.ipynb__: Visualization of the results obtained during tuning phase.
 - __EDCNN_training.ipynb__: Training of the propsed Encoder Decoder CNN architecture.
 - __Training results.ipynb__: Learning curves, denoised CT image
 
 __TODO__:
 - See the changes in bone structural parameters
 - Compare with non deep learning denoising techniques.
